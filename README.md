Dota 2 winning team prediction!

Some feature ideas:
- Heroes dummies
- Teams dummies
- is_persistent_team (has team_id)
- Amount of days since the beginning
- Heroes synergies ("heatmaps") for pairs, triples, etc.
- Team historical stats: farming, winning, etc.
- Players historical stats
- Counting teams as a set of players, because there are a lot of teams without `team_id` (they are forming just for play)

The plan is: add feature by feature :|
